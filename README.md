# A Practical Introduction to Prisma

# Welcome

üëã Welcome to the **A Practical Introduction to Prisma** workshop.

# Prerequisites

In order to successfully complete the tasks in the workshop, you should have:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine (12.2.X / 14.X)
- It is recommended (but not required) to use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for the practical tasks

That's it üôå (*no prior knowledge about SQL or Prisma is required*)

This repository contains the starter project for the **Database Workflows & API Development with Prisma** workshop by [Nikolas Burk](https://twitter.com/nikolasburk).

## Setup

### 1. Clone this repository

You can clone this repository with the following command:

```
git clone git@github.com:nikolasburk/prisma-workshop.git

Navigate into the project directory and install the npm dependencies with the following command:

```
cd prisma-workshop

```

# What you'll do

In this workshop, you'll learn about various workflows that are useful to know when using Prisma.

You'll start by setting up Prisma with a SQLite database, learn about data modeling with Prisma and performing database migrations (*lesson 1*).

Then, you'll learn about Prisma Client, a type-safe *query builder* that can be used to query your database. You're going to explore various queries, from plain CRUD, to relation queries, to filters and pagination (*lesson 2*).

Next, you'll learn how you can use Prisma Client to implement the routes of a REST API (*lesson 3*).

Finally, we'll cover how you can use Prisma Client to implement the resolvers of a GraphQL API (*lesson 4*).

# Lessons

[1. Set up Prisma](./lesson-1.md)

[2. Explore Prisma Client](./lesson-2.md)

[3. REST API](./lesson-3.md)

[4. GraphQL API](./lesson-4.md)

# What does a lesson look like?

A *lesson* is structured in two parts:

1. **Host walkthrough:** At the beginning of each *lesson*, your host will walk you through the different *tasks* you'll encounter in this lesson. Please *be attentive* during that time and follow the host's explanations to be sure that you can accomplish the tasks yourself when you're working on them later. **Do not code along or work on the tasks yourself yet!** Instead, you can think of questions or raise anything that you don't understand (e.g. in the **Q & A** section of Zoom).
2. **Do it yourself:** Once the host is done showing and explaining the different tasks, you get dedicated time to work on the tasks yourself!
